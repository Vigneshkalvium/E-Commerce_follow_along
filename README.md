# Ecommerce Follow Along Project
Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project**, this is a hands-on project we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDb, Express.js, React.js and Node.js). The goal is to learn hoe to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## Milestone 1: Project overview

#### 1. UnderStanding the MERN stack:
 **MongoDB :** A database for storing application data in a flexibla , document based format.
 **Express.js :** A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logics.
 **React.js :** A framework library for building User Interfaces.
 **Node.js :** A runtime environment that allows javascript to run on the server.

 #### 2. REST API Structure
 REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend.
 We'll create APIs for:
 - **User Authentication**: Allowing user to register and log in.
 - **Product Management**: Adding, Updating, and retreving product data.
 - **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

#### 3. Database Schema Design
We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB. A schema help us define how the data is stored and related.

#### 4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right pepole can access certain feautures. For Example:
- Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.
